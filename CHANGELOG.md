# Changelog

All notable changes to AgentNexus will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-02

### 🎉 Initial Release

First public release of AgentNexus — a production-grade, fully local ReAct single-agent CLI tool.

### Highlights

- **FSM-driven safety loop** — 16 states, 25 deterministic transitions govern the agent reasoning cycle
- **7-layer tool governance** — RBAC, schema validation, rate limiting, timeout, risk assessment, HITL, audit logging
- **213 security tests** — covering code execution, injection, sandbox escape, privilege escalation, and more
- **Fully local storage** — ChromaDB (vectors) + SQLite (relational) + JSONL (traces), nothing leaves your device
- **4-tier sandbox degradation** — E2B → bubblewrap/Seatbelt → Docker → local fallback

### Core Features

- ReAct agent with 3-tier LLM strategy degradation
- 17 built-in tools with full governance
- MCP integration (stdio/HTTP) with governance fusion
- Short-term memory (STM compression pyramid) + long-term memory (SQLite + ChromaDB)
- Knowledge base RAG with hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse + RBF + rerank)
- Code knowledge graph with semantic search
- Skill system with TF-IDF + learned reranker routing
- Sub-agent delegation for isolated task execution
- Observability: JSONL trace, token cost statistics, audit logs
- 8 built-in evaluators (agent, trajectory, hallucination, RAG, code, coherence, tool selection)

### Interfaces

- **CLI/TUI** — Terminal UI built with Typer + Rich + Textual
- **Desktop** — Electron + React 19 + TypeScript application
